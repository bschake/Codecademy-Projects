# Chatbot Capstone
## An Original Retrieval-Based Chatbot
### Codecademy username: @Barrett_Schake

I made this program as the final project for the Codecademy "Build Chatbots with Python" course.

This is a retrieval-based chatbot, which means it is designed to talk only about a specific topic.
The chatbot is designed to help an alien visitor learn about earth's animals. 
Type a question about an animal, and the chatbot will answer!

I chose the closed-domain architecture because although the chatbot can't discuss a huge variety of topics, it can provide accurate responses for the topic at hand.
Additionally, it requires less processing, so it doesn't need to run on a high-end GPU.  Lastly, as a closed-domain chatbot with preprogrammed responses, I have no ethical concerns that my chatbot will begin to say inappropriate things, as sometimes happens with generative chatbots.

The chatbot course has been very challenging.  As a fairly new programmer, I not only learned about AI and natural language processing, but also how to import and use Python modules, which I had not practiced before.

This particular chatbot uses spaCy and Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for natural language processing, as well as NumPy.
